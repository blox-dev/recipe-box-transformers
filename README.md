# recipe-box-transformers
A recipe generator for the [recipe box dataset](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/) using the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library with PyTorch.

I chose the gpt2 pretrained Models and AutoTokenizer for fine-tuning.

### PyTorch must be installed for this project to run.
